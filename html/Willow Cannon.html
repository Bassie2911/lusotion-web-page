            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            He was born and lived the most of his childhood in Roslas. He was surprisingly smart for someone born in Roslas. 
            Later on he moved on his own to Athana. He got some friends and a job as baker. After the destruction he joined the Athana clan. The clan is his home now.
