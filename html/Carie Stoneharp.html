            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Even if she's an elf, she doesn't have wings. She never really grew them and never wondered how it came. 
            Her parents and older brother participated in the war between 6 nations and Athana. 
            Sadly her sister got taken away by the "police" of Sensia. To this day she has a cold heart. 
            She once saw someone get murdered by a hunter in the woods and din't even bother to help the person. 
            She just stood there, careless. Those she still feels regret sometimes because of her warm heart part.
