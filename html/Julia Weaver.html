            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            ulia ran from the hunters trying to hunt her down. She ended up in a pile of death leaves. 
            With her heavy breathing she managed to pull out the arrow that hit her in her left arm. She lost consciousness not long after. 
            She woke up in a new place with an elf on a chair next to her. She left the place where she woke up. While she left she left the elf on the chair a small smile. 
            Julia had only 1 thing in mind from then. Kill all hunters!
