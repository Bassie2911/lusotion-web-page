            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            After the divorce of his parents, his dad met a man and they married. Since the Lace's school life changed. 
            The "cool kids" found out and started being mean. He is lucky to have Andrew at school and Alyssa at home to protect him. 
            Now he goes for his dream to make his hamburger obsession a job.
