            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            She wanders from place to place with only one thing in mind: "Kill them" All that happened because of a tiny accident in the past that involved people she loved. 
            When she visited the water city Onusa, she saw a wanted poster of a demon. Now she still carries that poster with her everywhere she goes. "One day, 
            I will get this demon and get the reward. I will make sure who will be the last person he will see."
