            History:
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            He was in his dining room with his parents when athana got attacked by the other cities. He could make it out before the big damage hit him. 
            On the way out of Athana he helped several citizens to get out. When he got his legs stuck under a building, all he thought was: "I lived a good life". 
            After his hope was all done , a younger girl was moving the planks and bricks. Togheter they ran out as quick as they could . Soon after, they started the Athana clan. 
            Goodwin is still gratefull to this day.
