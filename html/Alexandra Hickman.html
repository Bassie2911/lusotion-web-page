            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Alexandra was a kid that loved the forest. One day she found a heavy wounded girl in a pile death leaves. 
            She warned her brother and carried the girl to their house. 
            After they took care of the wounds they left her alone. Alexandra stayed with the girl until she woke up. 
            When she woke up she left the house. Looking emotionless in the eyes with a small smile. 
            Since then saw Alexandra her as a friend. They see eachother often in the forest.
