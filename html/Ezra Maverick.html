            History:
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            His parents are strict so he can't do as much as he wants. they do give his freedom tho. Ezra took that opportunity to go 
            and clear out the "tasks" his boss hs. He never clearly wanted to go out and kill people, he just wanted the money. Now 
            there's no way back, he can't leave his boss or he's done for. his cold heart is him dealing with all deaths he caused.
        </p>
