            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            His mother was a demon, his father was a wizard. Ray was born and raised in Onusa. 
            Since he has turned 18 the Acegla hunters are trying to hunt Ray down bc of shared race blood. 
            Ray had to say goodbye to his parents and ran off, alone in the forests. 
            He came in contact with the cold girl Charli and a handsome boy Willow. 
            They showed him their temporary camp. There he met Alexandra. They gave him a part of their supplies. 
            later he thanked them with fresh hunted meat.
