            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            A while ago did Lucerno almost drown in the lake nearby the city. Luckily a tresspasser saved him. 
            After that did Lucerno went to the library to learn how to swim. Lucerno learned that the ruler of Sensia, 
            Ortwin, is one of the only people who can kill city leaders. Since then Lucerno lives in a constant fear of seeing Ortwin around the city walls.
