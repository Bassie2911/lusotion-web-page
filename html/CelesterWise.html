            History:
        </h2>
        <p class="text">
            She was born en raised in the city of wisdom. She studied everywhere she could. 
            when she joined the hunting groups she immediately felt like it was her home. She slowly learned about the ruler, 
            about his power and about his abilities. One time she could read the rulers mind and 
            immediately ran off. Now she only wants to complete the plan she read from the ruler to make him acknowledge her.
