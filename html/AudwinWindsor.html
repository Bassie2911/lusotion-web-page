        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p class="text">
            He accidentally cursed himself in the young years, he casted an "immortal" spell on himself.
            He saw everyone die around him and doesn't feel a regret or tear after all those deaths.<br/>
            The only way to kill him is written in a letter deep down in underground ruins.
            Those events made him how he is today. A happy tyrant!
