            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Mother was a demon, fater a wizard. She used to play with her brother a lot. They told her he got out of the house "due adulthood". 
            Later on she found out the truth and it set her thinking about her 2 race blood. Her Yang side represents her Witch blood, Yin her Demon side. 
            Still to this day she keeps her demon side hidden and blames her sudden Yin bursts on a spell she accidently did. 
            She wants to search for her brother soon in the forests all around the cities.
