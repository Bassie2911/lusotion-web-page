            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a kid she used to watch her brother play mario.
            when she got older she followed his footsteps and started gaming too. She doesn't go to school anymore 
            since she got kicked out. She follows online school lessons instead now. This all happened when her dad 
            left to "get the milk". Now she lives her life how she wants, with her 2 best friends supporting her.
        </p>
