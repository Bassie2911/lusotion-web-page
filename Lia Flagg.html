            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            The period of her parents divorce made her question life and love. She sunk into a deep hole of thoughts and sadness. 
            Eventually she pulled herself out of there and re-lived her life like she never lived like it before. 
            That's why she studies a lot. It is so she can succeed.
