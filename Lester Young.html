            History:
        </h2>
        <p>
            A long long time ago she was in some underground hallways snooping around and trying to follow someone. When she finally found him a loud explosion went off in the room. 
            her coughing showed her position. the boy turned around and told her "I screwed up" in panic. He explained her that he accidently cursed them both with an immortal life. 
            She ran out of the underground rooms. She was happy that she couldn't die first. Now she is desperate to find the cure so she can finally rest.
